# Udacity Bikeshare Company

This project is an activity from Udacity's Data Science nanodegree. The project creates functions that filter data by city, month, and day of the week according to the user's request and return data about bikeshare stations, trips and users. For the data manipulation I used Dataframe from Pandas library. Since the project is limited to just the script with no visualization, I took the initiative to create a Power BI Dashboard with some additional information from the tables.

My biggest challenges were manipulating the SVG image graph, which was edited with Adobe Illustrator; and generating latitude and longitude columns in the table, because my only reference column was the address one and it didn't have any zip code or another address information that facilitates the use of traditional Python geocoding libraries. After trying Bing Maps API and Selenium, I managed to do it through Google Maps API.

The code and its respective docstrings are in the *Bikeshare_Project.py* file within the repository.
